# Stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

This workbook contains the tables of stock value returns in the past years and the refactoring code which can loop through any similar set of large stock dataset one time to successfully collect the necessary information faster with a click of button.

### The purpose 

The purpose of this project is to help Steve’s parents evaluate and compare the stock’s performance between 2017 and 2018 dataset at a glance and they can also use it for the future needs.

## Results
### Compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018

The followings are the functionality that the program VBA does and the tables provide the results of yearly stock’s volume and return in 2017 and 2018.

### Returns in 2017

In the table above illustrates the yearly return in 2017, we can clearly see that the DQ stock is the highest return value at 199.4%, and the lowest return is Run at 5.5%. and there is only one negative return which is Terp at -7.3%. Overall, there is a huge majority positive numbers of stock returns in 2017.  

### Returns in 2018 ![ VBA_Challenge_2018.png ](https://github.com/summerginger/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2018.png)

Compare the same stacks in 2018, in just over a year, the stokc market had been changed dramaticaly; for one with the highest high in 2017, DQ stock is plumged from 199.4% to the lowst low at -62.6% in 2018, it is the worst one among the others. However, the same story happened surprisingly to the Run stock, with the lowest return of 5.5% to the highest return point at 84%. overall, the stock marke this years' result is very bad.

### conclustion and recommandation

To conclude, stocks market can take staris going up and windows going down,the tables are only provide the return and volume, it is difficult to tell where the institutions may be putting their money, so we recommand that Steve need also to consider the other ways to protect and predict for his parents’ further investments.

###Compare the execution times of the original script and the refactored script

In the future, Steve’s parents may want to perform their analysis on larger datasets, and this timer code can help them to know how fast can the VBA compile the results.
This is the original script of code and the execution time is slightly more than the refactored code (the first image) in 2017.

However, it was unexpected to have the refactored code run slower for 2018, but both refactored
